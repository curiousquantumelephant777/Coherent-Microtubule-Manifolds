# Coherent-Microtubule-Manifolds
I propose that reduced external electromagnetic 'static' (as seen in certain delocalized states (e.g., Williams Syndrome or acute effects of phenethylamines) allows for superior phase-locking (pi-bond stacking/delocalization) between the microtubule lattice (Orch-OR interpretation) and the background geometric field.
