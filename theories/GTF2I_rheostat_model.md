# The GTF2I Rheostat Model: Signal-to-Noise Modulation in 7q11.23

## Abstract
I propose that the **GTF2I gene** (General Transcription Factor II-i) functions as a biological rheostat that determines the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** within the microtubule quantum manifold. This gene acts as a gating mechanism for the "static" that influences wavefunction collapse.

## Mechanical Hypothesis
* **Harmonic Resonance (Williams Syndrome Phenotype):** In deletion states, the reduction of GTF2I expression lowers the metabolic and electromagnetic "measurement" threshold. This facilitates sustained $\pi$-bond delocalization, allowing the microtubule lattice to phase-lock with the background geometric field (the theoretically oscillating "Flower of Life" quantum field).
* **Jagged Interference (ASD/Duplication Phenotype):** Overexpression or high-gain states of GTF2I increase internal "static" (potentially via IL-6/IL-16 pathways). This noise acts as a continuous observer, forcing premature and dissonant wavefunction collapse, resulting in a fragmented or "jagged" subjective experience.

## Biological Bridging
The GTF2I rheostat likely modulates the availability of **Nitric Oxide** and the structural integrity of **Perineuronal Nets (PNNs)**, which serve as the physical insulation for quantum coherence in the brain.

## **Scientific Context & Disclaimer:** 
"This model is a speculative extension of the **Orch-OR framework**. While GTF2I is traditionally classified as a transcription factor, we hypothesize a downstream biophysical effect on quantum coherence. This repository serves as a sandbox for modeling these potential interactions."

## **Note on Established Science:**
While GTF2I is traditionally understood as a transcription factor and calcium regulator, this model investigates potential quantum-level implications of its biological signaling.
